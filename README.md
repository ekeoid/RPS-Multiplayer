# RPS-Multiplayer

### Homework #7 Instructions

* Create a game that suits this user story:
    * Only two users can play at the same time.
    * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
    * The game will track each player's wins and losses.
    * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
    * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
    * Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.
